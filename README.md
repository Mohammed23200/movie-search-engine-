# Movie Search Engine üé•

## Overview

The **Movie Search Engine** is a simple and interactive web application built using [React](https://reactjs.org/). It allows users to search for movies and retrieve details like title, release year, genre, and ratings. This project is designed as a learning tool for beginners to grasp the fundamentals of React, including components, state management, and API integration.

## Features

- üîç Search for movies by title.
- üìã View movie details such as release year, genre, and rating.
- üé® User-friendly and responsive interface.

## Project Goals

This project is aimed at:
- Learning the basics of React.
- Understanding how to fetch and display data from an external API.
- Building a responsive and interactive UI.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, CSS
- **API:** [OMDb API](https://www.omdbapi.com/) (free movie database API)

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-search-engine.git
   cd movie-search-engine
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your OMDb API key:
   ```env
   REACT_APP_OMDB_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

## How It Works

1. The user enters a movie title in the search bar.
2. The app sends a request to the OMDb API to fetch movie details.
3. The results are displayed dynamically on the page.

## Screenshots

## Future Enhancements

- Add filters for genre, rating, and year.
- Include a "Favorites" feature to save movies.
- Add pagination for better data handling.

## Learning Outcomes

- Understand the basics of React components and props.
- Learn how to manage state using React hooks.
